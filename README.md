# Rose Sword
Rose Sword is a mod for BTA! which adds in the titular Rose Sword, aswell as a full set of armour. Requested by thatsus_guy aka Woody.
Half the durability of steel, slightly weaker than diamond, this tier of equipment fills a niche between iron and diamond, aswell as having significant fall damage resistance.
